# forest_fire_project_uni
Forest Fire Project- Model Deployment using Docker and MLFlow

## Dataset Information
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires (target variable: area)

## Information
In this project we performed the following:
1. Data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding
categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Investigate MLflow and its significance in managing the end-to-end DS lifecycle,
including experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment.
3. Train and evaluate a neural network for regression using a framework of your choice
(e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch), while logging experiments, parameters, and metrics
with MLflow. Describe the model architecture, training process (loss function,
optimizer, epochs), and how MLflow is used to track results.
4. Utilize the trained model to make predictions on fresh, unseen data points.
5. Used Fast-API for Deployment
